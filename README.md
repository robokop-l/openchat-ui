### Changing the AI Model

You can change the AI model by updating the `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENROUTER_MODEL` in your `.env.local` file. OpenRouter supports various models including:

- `anthropic/claude-3-opus:beta`
- `meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct:nitro`

- `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free`

Check the [OpenRouter documentation](https://openrouter.ai/docs) for a full list of supported models.

### Styling

The UI is built with Tailwind CSS and can be easily customized by modifying the Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.ts` and the component styles.

- `chat-input.tsx` - The chat input component
